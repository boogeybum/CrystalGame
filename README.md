## Technology
* Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
* Live demo: https://boogeybum.github.io/CrystalGame/

## About
* The Crystal Game is about assigning random values to button elements, in this case images, that you then click to determine the elements number value and click to add to your score while trying to have your clicked value equal the value of the random generated target number without going over. After each game the random values reset within a pre-determined range and the wins or losses values are updated to reflect the outcome of the previous game. The wins and losses values reset to zero if the browser is reloaded.

## License 
* No license explicite or implied.


## How-to use this code
* In a web browser, follow the on-screen instructions by clicking on the character images to incrementally add to the score trying to have your total add up to the random target value. 
* The the game automatically restarts at the end of each round with the computer selecting a new random number and reseting the player's guesses all while maintaining the wins and losses for games played so far. The game's wins and losses are reset when the browser is refreshed.
